# Applied Data Science Capstone Project

This repository contains the final project developed as part of the **Applied Data Science Capstone** course.

## üìò About the Project

The goal of this capstone was to apply the complete data science workflow‚Äîfrom data collection to prediction‚Äîto a real-world dataset. This project includes data wrangling, exploratory data analysis (EDA), SQL-based exploration, interactive visualizations, geographic mapping, and predictive modeling using classification techniques.

The final deliverables include:

- Jupyter Notebooks for each stage of the project
- datasets used in the development of the project

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Note:** While several notebooks are based on the instructional material provided in the course, many have been **extended and customized** as part of this final project. The **original authors** of each notebook are credited within their respective files in order to respect intellectual property rights.
